Ada Server Faces

Ada Server Faces allows to create web applications using the same pattern
as the Java Server Faces (See JSR 252). 

To build ASF, you will need:

 - Ada Util (http://code.google.com/p/ada-util)
 - Ada EL   (http://code.google.com/p/ada-el)
 - AWS      (http://libre.adacore.com/libre/tools/aws/)

Build with the following commands:

   ./configure
   make


The samples can be built using:

   gnatmake -Psamples
   
   
The unit tests are built using:

   gnatmake -Ptests


And unit tests are executed with:

   bin/asf_harness
